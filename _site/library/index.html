			The memoir of a trans woman illustrated with funny animals. Charlie Brown is there. Surreal, one-of-a-kind comic. You'll laugh, you'll cry - you'll mostly cry. A lot. At least, I did.

			Zine about why you feel weird about being attracted to girls and looking like a man and having body hair and having a man's voice and having short hair and - huh? I think I was saying something relevant there. Send this to every man in your phone.

			You know that joke about the Bechdel test? As it turns out, the comic it came from, "Dykes to Watch Out For", actually features a whole lot more than just a joke that people take too seriously sometimes. Quoting from Bechdel's site here, "Alison Bechdelâ€™s comic strip Dykes To Watch Out For became a countercultural institution among lesbians and discerning non-lesbians all over the planet. And her more recent, darkly humorous graphic memoirs about her family have forged an unlikely intimacy with an even wider range of readers." It's a comic that's well worth your time.
